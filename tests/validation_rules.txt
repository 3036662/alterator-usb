List of conditions:

    localtime(time_range): Evaluates to true if the local time is in the specified time range. time_range can be written either as HH:MM[:SS] or HH:MM[:SS]-HH:MM[:SS].
  NOT_SUPPORTED - allowed-matches(query): Evaluates to true if an allowed device matches the specified query. The query uses the rule syntax. Conditions in the query are not evaluated.
    rule-applied: Evaluates to true if the rule currently being evaluated ever matched a device.
    rule-applied(past_duration): Evaluates to true if the rule currently being evaluated matched a device in the past duration of time specified by the parameter. past_duration can be written as HH:MM:SS, HH:MM, or SS.
    rule-evaluated: Evaluates to true if the rule currently being evaluated was ever evaluated before.
    rule-evaluated(past_duration): Evaluates to true if the rule currently being evaluated was evaluated in the pas duration of time specified by the parameter. past_duration can be written as HH:MM:SS, HH:MM, or SS.
    random: Evaluates to true/false with a probability of p=0.5.
    random(p_true): Evaluates to true with the specified probability p_true.
    true: Evaluates always to true.
    false: Evaluates always to false.

Interpretation of the set operator:

    all-of: Evaluate to true if all of the specified conditions evaluated to true.
    one-of: Evaluate to true if one of the specified conditions evaluated to true.
    none-of: Evaluate to true if none of the specified conditions evaluated to true.
    equals: Same as all-of.
    equals-ordered: Same as all-of
